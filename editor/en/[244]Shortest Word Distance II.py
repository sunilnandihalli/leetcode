# Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implemen
# ts a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the shortest distanc
# e between these two words in the list. Your method will be called repeatedly man
# y times with different parameters. 
# 
#  Example: 
# Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]. 
# 
#  
# Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
# Output: 3
#  
# 
#  
# Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
# Output: 1 
# 
#  Note: 
# You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are bot
# h in the list.
