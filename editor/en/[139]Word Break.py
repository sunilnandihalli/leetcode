# Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-
# empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of 
# one or more dictionary words. 
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  
#  The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentat
# ion. 
#  You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words. 
#  
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pe
# n apple".
# Â             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
# Output: false
