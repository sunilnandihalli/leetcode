# Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using mul
# tiplication, division and mod operator. 
# 
#  Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor. 
# 
#  The integer division should truncate toward zero. 
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
# Output: 3 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
# Output: -2 
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  
#  Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers. 
#  The divisor will never be 0. 
#  Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers wit
# hin the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For the purpose of this pr
# oblem, assume that your function returns 231 − 1 when the division result overfl
# ows.
