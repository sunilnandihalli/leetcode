# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least
#  one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. 
# 
#  Example: 
# 
#  
# Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
# Output: 6
# Explanation:Â [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

#  If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using 
# the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
