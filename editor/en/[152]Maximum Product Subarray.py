# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (con
# taining at least one number) which has the largest product. 
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: [2,3,-2,4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: [-2,0,-1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
