# Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 
# and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume t
# hat there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one. 
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
# Output: 2
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
# Output: 3 
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  
#  You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only). 
#  You must use only constant, O(1) extra space. 
#  Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2). 
#  There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated mor
# e than once.
