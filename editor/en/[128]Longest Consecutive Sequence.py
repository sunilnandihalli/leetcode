# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutiv
# e elements sequence. 
# 
#  Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity. 
# 
#  Example: 
# 
#  
# Input:Â [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Theref
# ore its length is 4.
