# Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements. 
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
# Output: [1,2]
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1] 
#  
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  
#  You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements. 
#  Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is t
# he array's size.
