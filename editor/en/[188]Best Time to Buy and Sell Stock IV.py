# Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock
#  on day i. 
# 
#  Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k tr
# ansactions. 
# 
#  Note: 
# You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sel
# l the stock before you buy again). 
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 
# 4-2 = 2.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 
# 6-2 = 4.
# Â             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), prof
# it = 3-0 = 3.
